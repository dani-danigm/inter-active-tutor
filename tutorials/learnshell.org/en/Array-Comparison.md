Arrays 
Shell can handle arrays
An array is a variable containing multiple values. Any variable may be used as an array. There is no maximum limit to the size of an array, nor any requirement that member variables be indexed or assigned contiguously.
Arrays are zero-based: the first element is indexed with the number 0. 
   
	# basic construct
    ARRAY=(value1 value2 ... valueN)
